I found Repetition and Proximity in the CRAP Principle to be the most useful when creating the Presentation. 
Not only was my workflow faster because I didn't need to think of being more unique in the following slides, it also emphasized my preferred style to the audience. 
While not inherently 'hard,' I found the lack of modularity (aside from color modification) in pre-existing graphics and elements in Canva to be annoying because even a minor change like wanting to reposition a line within it is impossible. 
Regarding visual communication, I found it helpful to hide certain elements before I talk about it (via blocking walls of text with my body in the video), helping with audience focus.

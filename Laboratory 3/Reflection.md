Just like Laboratory 2, the easiest design was the banner since I'm just reusing it. 
Although if I don't include the banner, the promotional poster is one that I found the easiest since it was less personal and most of my thoughts went into visual design.
The fonts and color palette branding elements are still being used in my photos.
I ensure readability by contrasting texts to their respective backgrounds, as well as placing outlines on texts that would normally seem interlinked with an unrelated element.
I also ensured that the hierarchy of importance in both promo and square post are clear. 
The promotional poster highlights the title and the description of the workshop, whereas the square post makes it visible what to focus on. 
What I've learned about social media graphics is that although a striking visual design captures audiences, the audience may lose attention to important details if it doesn't stand out.
